My personal evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of the project design and organization

#Advantages:

      - The code is easy to read and make change to it.
  
      - The idea is straight-forward

      - Minimal number of object initially loaded on scene

#Organization disadvantages:

      - Editor folder should be right below the Assets folder for best performance and avoid build error
